In Frontend 
Under the path frontend\src\routes\AppRoutes.tsx
Generate a routes definition file that:

1. Exports an array named `appRoutes`.
2. Each route object contains:
   - path (string)
   - label (string)
   - element (React.lazy component)
3. Use React.lazy() to lazy-load:
   - HomePage from "../pages/HomePage.tsx"
   - OrdersPage from "../pages/ProductsPage.tsx"
4. Export the default appRoutes array.
5. Use TypeScript (tsx), fix any errors and warnings related to the code.
6. Output only the complete file content for frontend\src\routes\AppRoutes.tsx and nothing else.
