In frontend
Update the file at frontend/src/App.txs.
Requirements:
- Use React, react-router-dom, and MUI.
- Import BrowserRouter, Routes, Route from react-router-dom.
- Import MainLayout from "./layouts/MainLayout".
- Import appRoutes from "./routes/AppRoutes".
- Wrap lazy-loaded routes with React.Suspense and use MUI CircularProgress as fallback.
- Create nested routes: root "/" renders MainLayout and child routes are mapped from appRoutes.
- Include a 404 fallback route.
- Use TypeScript, fix any errors and warnings related to the code.
- Output only the full file content for src/App.tsx and nothing else.
